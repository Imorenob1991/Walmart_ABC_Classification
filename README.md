# Walmart_ABC_Classification
This project involves performing ABC classification on a dataset that containing 1,913 days of historical sales data from 10 Walmart stores, covering 3,039 different SKUs. The objective is to classify the SKUs based on their contribution to total revenue and unit sales. Lets Rock!

## Data Source

First of all, I want to mention that the data was obtained from Kaggle. Kaggle is the world's largest data science community, offering powerful tools and resources to help you achieve your data science goals.

Context: This dataset is openly available for academic purposes. The initial objective was to share historical data and then, through a competition, determine the group that had the best forecast accuracy. In this case, we will use this data for product segmentation. However, it is also an excellent dataset for practicing your forecasting and time series analysis skills.
